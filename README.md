# Movie Database – A MongoDB movie database

*Abstract* – This project illustrates a solution proposal for the creation of a MongoDB database containing data from the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes online movie databases. The necessary steps for performing the preliminary data ingestion and curation are presented and discussed. In addition, multiple standard and aggregation queries are solved and motivated, together with a custom query of interest which can be useful in a real use case.

Project work for course "Advanced Databases" during my 2nd Level Specializing Master's Programme at Polytechnic University of Turin.
